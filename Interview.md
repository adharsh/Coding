There's no greater mistake in an interview than silence, in my opinion. Especially when doing things like whiteboard coding. If you're going down the wrong track but are explaining what you're doing, perhaps I can subtly suggest you try a different direction that would be more productive. If you're just standing there in silence, however, I have no idea if you've come up with a brilliant O(n) sorting algorithm no one's seen before or if you've been lobotomized prior to entering the room. Explain what you're thinking - what options you thought up, what options you rejected (and why!), what direction you're thinking of going, what problems you'd have, how you'd test it, whatever - just keep talking.

My interviewer asked me about which project that I had worked on that I was most proud of/most passionate about. He wanted me me to explain why I thought it was so cool, what aspects of it were challenging, and he kept insisting that I sketch out parts of the architecture or specific data-structures from the project on a white board that was in the room. I highly recommend preparing for this sort of question. Microsoft really aims to hire people that are passionate about programming and the beginning of the interview will be your chance to prove that you are that type of person.
